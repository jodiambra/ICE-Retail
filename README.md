# ICE-Retail

We are looking at data from Ice, an online retail store for video games. The data set includes categories based on genre, platform, rating, sales, release year, critic, and user scores.  

The purpose of this project is to collect historical data, and apply insights to determine whether a game will succeed or not in the future. These insights will be used to optimize capital allocation in regards to advertising potentially big winners. We will be determining total sales,  and the distribution  of sales across the different platforms. We will illustrate which platforms lead, and lag in sales. Data analysis will determine the most popular platforms and genres. Investigations will determine if the average user ratings of certain platforms are the same, or if the average ratings of certain genres are the same.
